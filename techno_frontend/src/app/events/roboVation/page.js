                  Robo soccer is one of the Famous challenges of robovation in
                  this event teams comes with single robot and chase ball around
                  the big size of arena with the aim to kick more goals than the
                  opponent these games give opportunity to youngsters to solve
                  robotic challenges, built creative bots while learning
                  engineering technology. the most rewarding part of designing
                  bots is that student have fun, work together as a team and
                  robot specially design for robo soccer match. the event is
                  aimed at testing the flipping, kicking maneuvering skills and
                  control of the robot. The event mainly consists of ROUND 1 AND

                  youngsters to design, build and control combat robots to
                  demonstrate their creativity, engineering skills and driving

                  The competition is based on a time system. There will a
                  qualifying round for each team.

                  The most rewarding part of designing bots is that students
                  have fun, and work together as a team.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The top team from qualifying round will make it to the final
                  round on basis of no of times it moved out an opponent from
                  the ring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If any of the robots starts off before start up call, the
                  counter would be restarted and the BOT will get a second
                  chance. If repeated again then team will be disqualified.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your robot must be ready when call is made for your team.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Team members will be allowed only four times to touch or reset
                  their robots position during the run. However, this will lead
                  to a time penalty and timer will not stop during this course
                  of action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The robot will be judged on the basis of (in priority): - The
                  Time taken to move out the opponent from the ring b) No of
                  times move out opponent from the ring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Must not contain any readymade kits, pneumatic &hydraulic
                  systems, IC engines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Decisions about your robot will be taken by the organizers.

                <li>
                  No team will get a second chance after completing the game.

                  Certificates of Participation will be given to all the teams
                  participating in the event, but not to the teams that get
